javascriptpractice
==================

This was my first practice using javascript in a project during my time at The Iron Yard Academy. 

The project was to create a mock social media sign up page with no data persistance that would do some level of form validation and display the sign up information on the page.

This project is very rough as it is from the early parts of my education and is a project I plan to go back and update to make look cleaner.
